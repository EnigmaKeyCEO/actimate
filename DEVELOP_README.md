# Development Process

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have the latest version installed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install globally using the command `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- **EAS CLI**: Install using `npm install -g eas-cli`.
- **Netlify CLI**: Install using `npm install -g netlify-cli`.
- **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have access to the repository and necessary permissions.

## Development Workflow
1. **Start the development server**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This command initializes the Expo development server, enabling live reloading and debugging.

2. **Run the web version**:
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```
   Launches the application in a web browser using Vite as the build tool.

3. **Test functions locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Runs Netlify Functions and the Expo development server concurrently, allowing you to test serverless functions alongside the frontend.

4. **Test iOS locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:ios
   ```
   Opens the application in the iOS simulator and connects it with the development server for testing on iOS devices.

## Building for Production
- **Use EAS CLI for building**:
  ```bash
  npx eas build --platform ios
  ```
  This command initiates the build process for the iOS platform, generating binaries suitable for distribution.

- **Build for Android**:
  ```bash
  npx eas build --platform android
  ```
  Generates the APK/AAB files for Android distribution.

- **Build for Web**:
  ```bash
  npm run build:web
  ```
  Compiles the web application for production deployment.

## Code Quality
- **Linting**:
  Run the following command to check for code style issues:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
  Ensures consistency and adherence to defined coding standards across the codebase.

- **Testing**:
  Execute unit tests using:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  Ensures that individual components and functions behave as expected.

- **Type Checking**:
  ```bash
  npm run ts:check
  ```
  Validates TypeScript types throughout the project to prevent type-related errors.

## Architecture and Design
- **Monorepo Structure**:
  The project is organized within a monorepo, containing both frontend and backend codebases. This approach facilitates code sharing, easier dependency management, and synchronized deployments.

- **State Management**:
  Utilizes React's Context API and custom hooks to manage global state, ensuring efficient data flow and state synchronization across components.

- **Component Design**:
  Emphasizes modular and reusable components, promoting maintainability and scalability. Components are categorized into actions, modals, headers, folders, and files for better organization.

## Backend Integration
- **Netlify Functions**:
  Serverless functions are implemented using Netlify Functions, handling all backend operations such as folder and file CRUD operations, and generating signed URLs for secure image uploads/downloads.

- **AWS Services**:
  Integrates AWS S3 for image storage and DynamoDB for metadata storage. AWS SDK is utilized within Netlify Functions to interact with these services securely.

- **API Design**:
  Follows RESTful principles, providing clear and consistent endpoints for frontend consumption. Proper error handling and input validation are implemented to enhance reliability.

## Collaboration and Version Control
- **Branching Strategy**:
  Adheres to Gitflow workflow, maintaining separate branches for features, development, and production to streamline collaboration and integration.

- **Pull Requests**:
  All changes must be reviewed via pull requests, ensuring code quality and facilitating knowledge sharing among team members.

- **Commit Messages**:
  Follows Conventional Commits standards for clear and descriptive commit messages, aiding in project tracking and history analysis.

## Security Considerations
- **Environment Variables**:
  Sensitive information such as API keys and AWS credentials are managed through environment variables, preventing exposure in the codebase.

- **IAM Roles and Policies**:
  AWS IAM roles are configured with the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to services and functions.

- **Data Protection**:
  Ensures that all data interactions, especially those involving user-generated content, are secure and comply with best practices.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  Automated pipelines are set up using GitHub Actions, triggering tests and deployments on code commits and pull requests to maintain code integrity and streamline releases.

- **Automated Testing**:
  Integrates unit and integration tests within the CI pipeline, ensuring that new changes do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality.

## Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Dependency Conflicts**:
    - Ensure all dependencies are compatible by regularly updating packages and resolving version conflicts.
  - **Build Failures**:
    - Check build logs for specific error messages.
    - Verify that all environment variables are correctly set.
  - **API Errors**:
    - Ensure that AWS services are correctly configured and accessible.
    - Validate that Netlify Functions have the necessary permissions.

- **Debugging Tools**:
  - **Expo Dev Tools**: Utilize the web-based interface for inspecting and debugging the application.
  - **Netlify Logs**: Access logs through the Netlify dashboard to monitor function executions and identify issues.
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitor AWS service logs to track function performance and errors.

- **Support**:
  - Refer to official documentation for [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/), and [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).
  - Engage with community forums and developer communities for additional assistance.

## Best Practices
- **Code Reviews**:
  Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain high code quality and share knowledge among team members.

- **Documentation**:
  Keep all documentation up-to-date, ensuring that new features and changes are well-documented for future reference.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  Regularly profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Scalability**:
  Design the architecture with scalability in mind, allowing the application to handle increased loads and future feature expansions seamlessly.
